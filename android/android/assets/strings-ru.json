  "ttr_a1l4_fb_1": "Look at it! It wears... a helmet?",
  "ttr_a1l4_fb_2": "Looks legit. Meanwhile, this helmet defends this slime from physical damage",
  "ttr_a1l4_fb_3": "But how did this creature put it on itself... I mean it has no hands or something...",
  "ttr_a1l4_fb_4": "I afraid I know who did that, and his name Bhastuse The Jolly",
  "ttr_a1l4_fb_5": "Did someone say my name? Enjoy some slimes, then we talk! See ya!",

  "ttr_a1l4_fb_7": "He is advisor of Ul, king's minister of science. That is bad. Move!",

  "ttr_a1l5_fb_1": "I am afraid that watcher's bastion is plundered",
  "ttr_a1l5_fb_2": "How did you know that? There is plenty to go to reach there",
  "ttr_a1l5_fb_3": "All these guardians' helmets could not appear from nothing. Bhastuse has stolen them",
  "ttr_a1l5_fb_4": "Let fight through and see what is happening there!",

  "ttr_a1l7_fb_1": "Woooow, what is this really?",
  "ttr_a1l7_fb_2": "Hello, friends! Let me present you slime mother! My pride! She will smash you! Ha ha ha!",
  "ttr_a1l7_fb_3": "Listen carefully. This creature may summon other slimes. Don't let it live for a long. Good luck",

  "ttr_a1l8_fb_1": "I know! I know! This red one is slime father!",
  "ttr_a1l8_fb_2": "But how did you know??? That is my secret project! See ya later, I need to check my lab!",
  "ttr_a1l8_fb_3": "This creature can stun you! Please be careful, we are getting closer!",
  "ttr_a1l8_fb_4": "Now there are more monsters in packs. You need to clear this second wave as well",
  "ttr_a1l8_fb_5": "I will ask king for jelly medal",

  "ttr_a1l9_fb_1": "Welcome to Watchers Bastion. I prefer its new name - the Slime Bastion!",
  "ttr_a1l9_fb_2": "I will smash your slimes, and then I will smash you!",
  "ttr_a1l9_fb_3": "You won't stand my hordes!",
  "ttr_a1l9_fb_4": "Did i mention about hordes? Slimes, charge!",

  "ttr_a1l11_fb_1": "So, we will get around the hills through the dryad forest, and reach Tower of Harmony faster!",
  "ttr_a1l11_fb_2": "Who did disturb our grove? You, little punk?",
  "ttr_a1l11_fb_3": "That tree... woman... speaking... to me?",
  "ttr_a1l11_fb_4": "The world is unstable! Dryad forest is disquieted! We should fight our way through!",

  "ttr_a1l14_fb_1": "Can't beleive you are still alive. I will stop you now! My friends asked me to win some time before they are done in the tower!",
  "ttr_a1l14_fb_2": "You have no friends since you married a snail mutant two years ago!",
  "ttr_a1l14_fb_3": "My private life is none of your business! Face my science now!",
